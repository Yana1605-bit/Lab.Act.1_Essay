    <h1>Essay: Introduction of Web Development</h1>
    <h2>by: Diana Mae J. Oxina</h2>

    <hr>

    <p> The lesson about making websites taught me about the basics of HTML and it is the process of building and maintaining a website. 
        In this lesson I've learned that it is about creating something functional, easily accessible, and user-friendly.
        Also, this web development explained that it has two main parts, which are the front-end and back-end development, and now I 
        know the difference between these two that the front-end focuses on what users see and interact with,
        while the back-end focuses on the data, servers, and logic behind the scenes. Additionally, I also learned that HTML is fun to 
        study because it's easy to understand, and I also realized that this language brings websites to life. Because HTML is the foundation 
        for the web. Because it provides the structure and content of the webpage, and I also learned that it organizes all the content, 
        just like what we see online. Without it, it wouldn't have basic elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms. 
        
    <br><br>In addition, I’ve learned how to use tags correctly, like the proper format for them. I realized that this lesson about Web 
        Development helped me appreciate and learn how to create websites, and it made me understand that every simple webpage starts from 
        basic HTML coding. Because of this, I'm becoming more curious about how to create a good website that is functional and visually 
        appealing. I also learned that you really need to know how to use HTML correctly because you're not just randomly designing; you 
        also need to think about the rules or how to use it properly, like with Headings to. I learned that if you use these correctly, 
        it will help make what I create with HTML more beautiful and organized. This helps me create main topics and smaller topics. 
        The paragraph is the main text; it helps me group sentences together to make sense. It also made me realize the importance of 
        writing good and presentable paragraphs so people can enjoy reading. The line break tag is simple to use and I understood it right 
        away because it separates the text to create a new line when needed.
    </p>
    
    <p> Another thing I learned is how important thinking, planning, and structure are in web development. Before I can create a website, 
        I first need to figure out my purpose, what it's for, how important it is, whether it will be helpful, and what kind of experience 
        users will have when using it. It's really important to study this because I learned the importance of keeping the code simple yet 
        clean and organized, as it will help me create websites easily. Maintaining and understanding the code is also important because it 
        helps me collaborate with others, such as in teams. Plus, I've learned that each tag plays a specific role in creating a website. 
        Being clean and presentable will make it easier for me to find out what the problem is. And in this lesson, I learned how tags like 
        Headings, Paragraphs, and Breaks work together for a webpage. Additional I learned that web development keeps evolving with new 
        frameworks and tools, but the basic concepts of HTML remain essential. Developing an understanding on these principles creates a 
        solid foundation that helps me explore more. Overall, II have now a knowledge of how websites work and how to make concepts come to 
        life on the web, developers combine both reason and creativity.
    </p>
    
    <p>After learning and understanding the fundamentals of HTML, what I envision myself doing in the future is creating my personal portfolio 
        website where I can showcase my completed projects, my skills, and my experiences. I will also include information about myself and how 
        and where I can be contacted. I think if I do this, I'll see a change in my creativity and improve my skills for this even more. 
        Another thing I'm thinking about is Goal-Tracking, because I think it can help more than just me. My goal for this is to keep my tasks 
        organized, and it should be easy for beginners to use. This is also based on my experience because I'm not good at managing my time, so 
        I think this will help me and others as well. The last thing I thot of was a website about what's happening right now, like weather, news, 
        etc., basically everything a person would want to know, so they can also be aware of the situation. So they'll know or get an update. 
    
    <br><br>These are the things I think might help everyone. But, as I said, I still need to think about it and find out other reasons for doing this. 
        In this Web Development lesson, I learned that coding can be an effective way to express ideas and creativity. By creating a website for 
        sharing information. It helped me understand how web development links creativity with technology, and I'm inspired to continue learning 
        and create future projects.
